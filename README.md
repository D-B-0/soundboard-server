# Soundboard server

This application allows you to play sounds in a somewhat syncronous fashion on multiple devices it can be used as a kind of soundboard, by using a tablet and having a browser tab open in the background.

The sounds are stored with an id, a name and an url, they aren't stored locally

### TODO:

- [ ] Set up a database to store the sounds in (currently done by json file ðŸ˜±)
- [ ] CRUD API for the sounds (with manual confirms)
